## Data Notes

The analysis uses provincial-level data from Statistics Canada (2000–2023).

Due to size and licensing considerations, raw data files are not hosted in this repository.
All data construction and cleaning steps are fully documented in the master Stata do-file.

Datasets can be reproduced using publicly available Statistics Canada tables.
